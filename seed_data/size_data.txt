Size	DescriptionLarge	"Some people live by the motto “bigger is better,” and it extends to their dogs too. There are many large dog breeds, each with different care and training needs. Most large dog breeds were bred for a purpose or function. Some breeds were meant to be hunters, others guard dogs. Dogs with great endurance brought livestock or produce to market or protected the farmer’s animals. Knowing the dog’s original purpose can be very important in determining the amount of exercise a dog will need. Large dog breeds that were bred to work all day will need daily activity to work off their energy."Medium	"These cuddly breeds can range from 35 to 65 pounds. Not too large, not too small, but juuust right."Small	"Small dogs come from a variety of AKC groups, so there is a perfect breed for every lover of little dogs with regards to personality, activity level and coat type. Keep in mind, small dogs are not just lapdogs – many of them are tough as nails. Smaller dogs don’t necessarily need to work off loads of energy, so they are quite suitable for apartment life. But not all small dogs live to be lap warmers! Certain breeds like Dachshunds or small terriers would also love country life and the opportunity to run around on a farm. If your family includes very young children, ensure that your small dog has a space to get away from the kids, or reconsider your choice of breed. Many Toy breeds are too delicate to compete with a boisterous family of young children and need to live in a quieter environment."
